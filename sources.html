        <h2>About ROCK PAPER SCISSORS</h2>
        <p>ROCK PAPER SCISSORS is a project for my Advanced Web Design course that demonstrates the use of web fonts and
            CSS animation.<br><br>
            The animation demonstrate the relationship between rock, paper, and scissors. <br>The words were included in
            the SVGs wherever they could
            to further develop to conflict between them.<br><br>
            Falcon font was chosen for the scissors font as this shows sharp edges, and has cuts throughout the font.
            <br>
            Science Gothic is a variable font used for the rock. It has a strong and sturdy foundation, something as
            strong as a rock.<br>
            Skia font was chosen for the paper. This was chosen in Inkscape and exported as an SVG.
